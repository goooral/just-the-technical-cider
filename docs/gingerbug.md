A ginger bug is a simple starter used to make homemade ginger beer or other fermented drinks.

## Ingredients:

1. 20 g grated ginger  
2. 4 tablespoons sugar  
3. 250 ml water  

## Instructions:

1. **Combine ingredients**: In a large glass jar, combine the grated ginger, sugar, and filtered water.  
2. **Cover and ferment**: Cover the jar with a cloth or paper towel secured with a rubber band. Place the jar in a warm, dark place (like a kitchen counter) and let it ferment for 3-5 days.  
3. **Feed the bug**: After the initial fermentation, you can "feed" your ginger bug every 2-3 days. To feed it, add two tablespoons sugar and a glass of water.  
4. **Strain and store**: Once your ginger bug is bubbly and has a strong ginger flavor, you can strain it to remove the solids. Store the liquid in a sealed container in the refrigerator.  

### Using Your Ginger Bug:

- **Ginger beer**: To make ginger beer, mix your ginger bug with additional water, sugar, and lemon juice. Bottle the mixture and let it carbonate for a few days.  
- **Other fermented drinks**: You can use your ginger bug to ferment other fruits and vegetables, such as berries or cucumbers.
