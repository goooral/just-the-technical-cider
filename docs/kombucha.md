# Kombucha

A refreshing tea-based drink.

![Kombucha](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goooral/just-the-technical-cider/refs/heads/main/images/kombucha.jpg "kombucha")

## Basic ingredients (for one litre of kombucha):

1. ~750 ml water  
2. 4 tablespoons of sugar  
3. 4 black/green tea bags (don't use herbal or fruit tea by itself, the caffeine in tea leaves is part of what feeds the yeast and bacteria)  
4. ~250 ml kombucha starter (from a previous batch of kombucha or store-bought - if store-bought, it must be unpasteurized)  
5. 1 SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeast) - if you have one. If you don't, not a problem, SCOBY will appear in your kombucha over time.  

You can also use additional tea, herbs, fruit, or substitute part of the sugar content with fruit syrup, as long as it is sugar-based.

## Instructions:

### Brew the Tea:

- Boil the water.  
- Stir in the sugar until dissolved.  
- Add the tea bags and any additional ingredients of your choice.  
- Let the tea cool to room temperature.  

### Prepare the Jar:

- Clean a glass jar thoroughly with hot water and soap or in a dishwasher.  
- Rinse well and let it air dry.  

### Combine Ingredients:

- Pour the cooled tea into the clean jar.  
- Add the starter liquid and SCOBY.  

### Fermentation:

- Cover the jar with a breathable cloth or a paper towel and secure it with a rubber band.  
- Place the jar in a warm, dark place (like a pantry or cupboard).  
- Let it ferment for a few days, up to a week (if you're preparing a larger batch, let it sit for longer).  
- Pour the kombucha into glass bottles. If some sugar remains and you keep the bottled kombucha stored in fermentation-friendly conditions for a few more days, your drink will carbonate.  

### Refrigerate and Enjoy:

- Once the desired flavor is reached, refrigerate the kombucha to stop the fermentation process.  
- Store in the refrigerator and enjoy within a few weeks.
