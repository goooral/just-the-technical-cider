## Ingredients:
* 10 liters NFC apple juice
* Cider yeast
* 80 grams sugar
* Optional: 100 grams erythritol

## Instructions:
**Prepare the yeast**: Follow the instructions on packaging.

**Prepare the juice**: 
1. Pour the juice into a sterilized plastic fermantator or a large glass jug. 
2. Fill only 75% of the container to prevent overflow. 
3. Add the yeast mixture and mix until fully combined.

**Set aside**: 
1. Close the lid tightly. 
2. Insert the airlock and add a few drops of water to seal it. 
3. Place the container in a dark and warm area. 
   
Remember that the contents might spill out during fermentation. This may happen if you leave insufficient space in the container or if you're using homemade juice.

**Fermentation**:
1. Leave the container for a week. Monitor the process. 
2. The airlock will start making a sound on day two. This indicates that fermentation has started. 
3. When the sounds stop after a few days, fermentation is complete.

**Second fermentation**: 
1. In order to carbonate your drink, add 8 grams sugar per 100 milliliters before bottling. 
2. Mix until the sugar dissolves completely.

***Optional***: 
You can sweeten your cider with erythritol. The cider is going to be sour and savory by default, as the yeast consumes the entire sugar content. In order to sweeten the drink, add a sweetener. 
1. Add 10 g per 100 ml to a small portion of the cider.
2. Taste the mixture. 
3. Adjust the proportion as needed.

**Transfer the cider to glass bottles:** 
1. Let the cider settle after stirring. This allows the sediment to collect at the bottom of the container. 
2. Pour the cider into glass bottles and seal them tightly. 
   
After two weeks your cider should be ready to drink. Setting it aside for longer will improve the flavour and enhance the carbonation.
