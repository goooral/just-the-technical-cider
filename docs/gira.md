![Kvass/Gira](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goooral/just-the-technical-cider/refs/heads/main/images/gira.jpg "gira")

## Ingredients:

1. 1 l water  
2. 100 g rye bread, dried and toasted (Lithuanian bread is strongly recommended)  
3. 50 g sugar  
4. 1 teaspoon yeast  

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare the bread**: Cut the rye bread into small pieces and dry them in a toaster oven or a regular oven until they are crispy.  
2. **Boil the water**: Bring the water to a boil in a large pot.  
3. **Add the bread**: Add the dried bread to the boiling water and let it steep for 15-20 minutes.  
4. **Cool and strain**: Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool completely. Strain the liquid to remove the bread pieces.  
5. **Add sugar and yeast**: Add sugar and yeast to the cooled liquid. Stir well to dissolve the sugar.  
6. **Fermentation**: Transfer the mixture to a clean, sterilized container. Cover the container with a cloth or paper towel and secure it with a rubber band. Let it ferment at room temperature for 1-2 days, or until it becomes bubbly and slightly acidic.  
7. **Bottle and store**: Once the fermentation is complete, strain the kvass to remove any sediment. Bottle the kvass and store it in the refrigerator.
